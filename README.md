# ToDoList
SDA Final Project
This is a final project from Software Development Academy training course on Java.
It was developed for training purposes only!!!
Inconsistencies in approaches to particular problems in the code are intentional
and are there to demonstrate knowledge about different possible approaches.

The app is strongly simplified version of tasks management system.

In the centre of this app lays dashboard on which different tasks are displayed.
Each task has some attributes and user assigned to it.
There are two kinds of users:
- admins that can create and control tasks (developser),
- users that can only view tasks and current progress (clients).

Ultimately there will be a set of projects. Each project will have its own admin.
Each admin will be able to view only his/hers tasks or project.
Users will be able to see only tasks from their projects.

Project utilises Spring Web MVC, Spring Security and Hibernate frameworks.
View layer is created using JSP. Database was created using MySQL.
It was built using Maven.
